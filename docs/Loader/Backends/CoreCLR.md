!!! note

    Microsoft does not publish a statically linked library for this; however, after some editing to .NET sources
    [Reloaded-II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/tree/master/source/Reloaded.Mod.Loader.Bootstrapper/nethost) 
    features a pre-built static lib for loading this runtime.
