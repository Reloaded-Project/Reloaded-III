!!! info "`'Workflows'` are a templating system used to help people create mods easier."

The core idea behind `Workflows` is the following:

1. A user wants to create a mod with a specific goal.
2. If it's a common goal, we should help them achieve that goal.

Most mods created by non-technical users are usually simple, common modifications that replace
models, textures or audio.

Eventually, some of these non-technical users may become more technical,
and the modding community grows.

## An Example

!!! example "Imagine you are an end user trying to make a [Persona 5 Royal][p5r] mod."

A typical user journey would go something like:

1. Perform a web search like:
    - `how to make a persona 5 royal mod`
    - `how to create a persona 5 royal mod`
2. Find a guide (hopefully), which will take you to:
    - The [Persona Essentials][persona-essentials] documentation.
    - And [Reloaded-II Mod Creation Documentation][r2-mod-creation-docs] as a sidequest.
3. Perform a series of manual steps to set up your mod from the [Persona Essentials][persona-essentials] documentation.

Step `3` needs to always be done, while steps `1` and `2` are a one-time learning experience.

***Unfortunately***, the user experience for this journey is not very good:

1. Searching `how to create mod`, will likely not yield the desired results, and instead
lead the user to guides on how to `use` mods.
    - In this case, the proper docs can only be found in a link on the second page of search results.
1. Once you do get going, the series of manual steps that need to be performed are tedious.
