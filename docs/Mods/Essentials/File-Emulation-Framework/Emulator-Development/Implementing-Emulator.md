!!! info "The following steps detail the process of creating a new emulator"

    All of the hard stuff is abstracted away from you ðŸ˜‰, if you can write a
    file packer in Rust, you can write an archive emulator.<br/>

    Or any other kind too, of course ðŸ˜‡.

!!! note "Reference code here is from C# [AFS emulator][afs-emulator]"

    This code was translated to Rust via an LLM, and then updated by hand.

Use this page as a general guide to the process of creating a new emulator.

## Initialization

!!! info "When your mod is initialising, you should register your emulator."

    As well as add some callbacks.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Mod Loader
    participant Emulator Mod
    participant FileEmulationFramework

    Emulator Mod->>Mod Loader: Register 'Mod.OnModLoading' callback
    Emulator Mod->>Mod Loader: Register 'Mod.OnLoaderInitialized' callback
    Emulator Mod->>FileEmulationFramework: Register trait implementing 'IEmulator' callback
```

A Reloaded-II example:

```csharp
_modLoader.ModLoading += OnModLoading;
_modLoader.OnModLoaderInitialized += OnModLoaderInitialized;
_emulator = new AfsEmulator();

// Get emulation framework API and register our emulator
_modLoader.GetService<IEmulationFramework>().TryGetTarget(out var framework);
framework!.Register(_emulator);
```

There are 2 callbacks involved here.

### OnModLoading

!!! info "This is called when the mod loader is intializing a mod."

In this callback, you inspect the other mods' files and add them to the emulator input.

```csharp
public void OnModLoading(string modFolder)
{
    // 'Constants.inputFolder' is 'AFS' in this case,
    // i.e. folder 'AFS' in the other mod's folder.
    var inputFolder = $"{modFolder}/{Constants.inputFolder}";

    if (Directory.Exists(inputFolder))
        _builderFactory.AddFromFolders(inputFolder);
}
```

We use the 'builder' pattern to create emulators.
The significance of which will be explained in [Building Emulated Files](#building-emulated-files).

### OnModLoaderInitialized

!!! info "This is called after all mods have finished initializing."

In this callback, unsubscribe `OnModLoading` to stop receiving runtime loaded mods.

```csharp
_modLoader.ModLoading -= OnModLoading;
_modLoader.OnModLoaderInitialized -= OnModLoaderInitialized;
```

## Building Emulated Files

!!! info "Describes the Process in which Emulated Files are Created."

Emulated files are lazily built 'Just in Time' (JIT) as the original files are accessed.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A(FileEmulationFramework loads file with route 'BGM.AFS')
    A --> B(AfsEmulator loads file with route 'BGM.AFS')
    B --> C(AfsBuilderFactory creates AfsBuilder for 'BGM.AFS', adds input info, and calls AfsBuilder.Build)
```

Once all mods load, and the game logic begins, the game will eventually try to access
a file we wish to create or alter with emulation.

This will call the `IEmulator` (`AfsEmulator`) instance registered during the [initialize](#initialization) phase.

### Builder Factory

!!! info "The builder is where you create the emulator."

The Builder Factory stores information about all available emulator inputs.

Implementations of builder factories (`AfsBuilderFactory`) may sometimes vary slightly,
but usually follow a pattern described below.

#### Collecting Input Data

!!! info "This is called from your [OnModLoading](#onmodloading) callback."

```csharp
private List<RouteGroupTuple> _routeGroupTuples = new();

/// <summary>
/// Adds all available routes from an input folder.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="inputFolder">Folder containing the redirector's files.</param>
public void AddFromFolders(string inputFolder)
{
    // Get contents of folder. These return files grouped by directory.
    DirectorySearcher.GetDirectoryContentsRecursiveGrouped(inputFolder, out var groups);

    // Find matching folders.
    foreach (var group in groups)
    {
        if (group.Files.Length <= 0)
            continue;

        var route = Route.GetRoute(inputFolder, group.Directory.FullPath);

        _routeGroupTuples.Add(new RouteGroupTuple()
        {
            Route = new Route(route),
            Files = group
        });
    }
}
```

Here we look inside a mod's specified files they want to add as input to the emulator.

For a given mod folder with the layout:

```
ModFolder
â””â”€â”€ FEmulator
    â””â”€â”€ AFS
        â”œâ”€â”€ EVENT_ADX_E.AFS
        â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 0_yahoo!.adx
        â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 1_kick.adx
        â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 2_jump.adx
        â””â”€â”€ EVENT_ADX_J.AFS
            â”œâ”€â”€ 0_yahoo!.adx
            â”œâ”€â”€ 1_kicku.adx
            â””â”€â”€ 2_jumpu.adx
```

We get `inputFolder` pointing to the full path of `ModFolder/FEmulator/AFS`.
The call to `GetDirectoryContentsRecursiveGrouped` will return us 2 groups (folders) with

```
EVENT_ADX_E.AFS
â”œâ”€â”€ 0_yahoo!.adx
â”œâ”€â”€ 1_kick.adx
â””â”€â”€ 2_jump.adx
```

and

```
EVENT_ADX_J.AFS
â”œâ”€â”€ 0_yahoo!.adx
â”œâ”€â”€ 1_kicku.adx
â””â”€â”€ 2_jumpu.adx
```

These are then added to the `_routeGroupTuples` list, with the `route`(s) being
`EVENT_ADX_E.AFS` and `EVENT_ADX_J.AFS`.

!!! note "The routes for each folder is the path following `ModFolder/FEmulator/AFS`"

    So if you had a nested folder, e.g. `ModFolder/FEmulator/AFS/EVENT_ADX_E.AFS/EVENT_MUSIC.AFS`,
    its route would be `EVENT_ADX_E.AFS/EVENT_MUSIC.AFS`.

#### Building The Emulated File

!!! info "This is called when the game [tries to access the file](#building-emulated-files)."

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Tries to create an AFS from a given route.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="route">The route to create AFS Builder for.</param>
/// <param name="builder">The created builder.</param>
/// <returns>True if a builder could be made, else false (if there are no files to modify this AFS).</returns>
public bool TryCreateFromRoute(Route route, out AfsBuilder builder)
{
    builder = new AfsBuilder();
    foreach (var group in _routeGroupTuples)
    {
        // group.Route is "EVENT_ADX_E.AFS" or "EVENT_ADX_J.AFS" in this example.
        // it is NOT the full file path
        if (!route.Matches(group.Route))
            continue;

        // Add files to builder.
        var dir = group.Files.Directory.FullPath;
        foreach (var file in group.Files.Files)
            builder.AddOrReplaceFile(Path.Combine(dir, file));
    }

    return builder != null;
}
```

The logic here is pretty simple.

Suppose a file with path `<PATH_TO_GAME_FOLDER>/dvdroot/BGM/EVENT_ADX_E.AFS` is being opened.
This will be our `route` parameter, in `TryCreateFromRoute`.

We loop over our routes (listed below) and check which match the requested path.

```
EVENT_ADX_J.AFS
EVENT_ADX_E.AFS
```

`route.Matches` will test the `route` parameter against both of these. In this case, `EVENT_ADX_E.AFS`
will match, so we will add the files from that folder into the Builder's Input.

!!! note "`route.Matches` checks if the route ends with `input`."

    So if the full path is `<PATH_TO_GAME_FOLDER>/dvdroot/BGM/EVENT_ADX_E.AFS`,
    `route.Matches` will return `true` for `EVENT_ADX_E.AFS` because it ends with
    `EVENT_ADX_E.AFS`.
