# Images

!!! note "In certain places, Reloaded may use images to represent mods, games, etc."

!!! tip "All images in R3 use JPEG XL (`.jxl`)."

## Allowed Image Formats

Reloaded3 exclusively uses JPEG XL (`.jxl`) for images. Throughout every single part of the system.

However, exporting to `jxl` is still not common, therefore launchers and other tools should be able to
handle at least the following formats:

- `.png`
- `.jpg`
- `.webp`

And convert them to `.jxl` on the fly.
