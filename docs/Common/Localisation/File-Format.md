# Localisation File Format

!!! info "A description of the custom format used by Reloaded for localising."

The file format used by Reloaded3 for localization is designed to deliver a good tradeoff between:

- Human Readability (especially for non-programmers)
- Parsing Speed

## Cheat Sheet

- `##` denotes the line is a comment
- `[[KEY]]` marks an entry.

## Entries

Translatable keys are represented in the following format.

```toml
[[KEY]]
Value
```

A key starts with `[[` and ends with `]]`.

All text after `]]` is discarded.

The value is read from the start of the next line.

!!! tip "Standard style for keys uses the following"

    - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
    - Shorthand or exact string as stored in text.

## Comments

Comments may be represented by a `#` at the start of a line,
in which case the entire line is ignored by the parser

```toml
## This is a comment
[[KEY]]
```

Alternatively, it's possible to put comments next to the keys.

```toml
[[KEY]] # This is a comment
```

Since all characters after `]]` are ignored.

## Escape Characters

!!! info "No characters are escaped. Every character is treated literally."

Lines that are not comments should simply not start with `##` or `[[`.

!!! tip "As a workaround, you can use a `Zero Width White Space` at the start of a line, if an escape is really needed."

New lines are saved as `\n`. Any sequences of `\r\n` should be converted to `\n`.

## Placeholders

Placeholders for string formatting may be included with `{}`.

```toml
[[KEY]]
This is a string with a placeholder: {}
```

Multiple placeholders may also be used:

```toml
[[KEY]]
This is a string with multiple placeholders: {} and {}
```

These placeholders should map to a programming language's given string formatting system.
For example, in Rust, this would be `format!(text(KEY), value1, value2)` and in C#
this would be `string.Format(text(KEY), value1, value2)`.

For some languages, it may be necessary to manipulate the returned string to match the native format
upon initial file read. For example, a C# implementation might want to replace first `{}` with `{0}`.

!!! tip 

    An implementing library may also provide an export like `get_text_formatted(KEY, values)`, where
    `values` is a list of strings to be inserted into the placeholders.

## Update 1.2.0 | 2024 June 3rd
## Added Error Handling
[[ERROR_UNKNOWN]]
Unknown Error

[[ERROR_FAILED_TO_START_PROCESS]]
Failed to start the process. This generally happens due to one of the 2 issues:
- The program is configured to run as administrator (right click -> properties) but Reloaded is running in user mode.
- Interference from e.g. Antivirus software. Check your logs.

Here is the error returned from your OS {}
```

## Syntax Highlighting

!!! tip "You may be able to get good syntax highlighting by setting your language as TOML."
