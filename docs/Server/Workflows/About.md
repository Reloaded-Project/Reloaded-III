# Workflows: A Templating System for Easier Mod Creation

!!! info "'Workflows' are a templating system designed to simplify the mod creation process."

The primary goals are:

1. Identify common mod creation objectives
2. Provide streamlined assistance for these objectives

Most mods created by non-technical users typically involve simple modifications such as replacing models, textures, or audio.

By simplifying this process, we can help grow the modding community and potentially inspire some users to become more technically proficient over time.

## The Current User Journey

!!! example "You are an end user trying to make a [Persona 5 Royal][p5r] mod."

1. **Initial Search**:
    - User searches for phrases like `how to make a Persona 5 Royal mod`
    - Often leads to guides on how to *use* mods ‼️, not create them

2. **Finding the Right Resources**:
    - If lucky, user finds the [Persona Essentials][persona-essentials] documentation
    - And will also encounter [Reloaded-II Mod Creation Documentation][r2-mod-creation-docs]

3. **Manual Setup**:
    - User follows a series of manual steps from the [Persona Essentials][persona-essentials] documentation

While steps 1 and 2 are one-time experiences, step 3 must be repeated for each new mod.

## Current Challenges

!!! failure "The user experience for mod creation is often suboptimal"

1. **Discoverability Issues**:
    - General searches like `how to create mod` rarely yield relevant results
    - Proper documentation is often buried in search results

2. **Tedious Manual Processes**:
    - Once documentation is found, users face a series of repetitive, manual steps

## The Vision: An Ideal Workflow
