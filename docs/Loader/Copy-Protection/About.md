# About Copy Protection (DRM)

!!! info

    This section notes things we should be mindful of when dealing with various pieces of
    Digital Rights Management (Copy Protection), and similar mechanisms.

The purpose of copy protection is to prevent 3rd party tampering with games.

And unfortunately, naturally, that means sometimes copy protection gets in the way of modding.

## Suggestions & Actions

### Prefer DRM-Free Versions

!!! info "Mods should always target DRM-Free version(s) of games if available."

In some rare scenarios a game may be officially distributed in both 
DRM-Free and ***Defective by Design*** versions.

Example: `Yakuza: Like a Dragon`

- [DRM Free Goodness](https://www.gog.com/en/game/yakuza_like_a_dragon) on GOG
- [Denuvo Infested Garbage](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1235140/Yakuza_Like_a_Dragon/) on Steam

The Steam version is harder to mod, may have more performance issues and will one day...

***STOP. WORKING. FOREVER.***

With the GOG version, you can at least have peace of mind and one day show your kids or grandkids
the joy of your childhood games.
