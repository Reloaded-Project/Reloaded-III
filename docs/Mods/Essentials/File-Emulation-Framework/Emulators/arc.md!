!!! info

    ARC (or ARCL) is a archive format used in Jet Set Radio.  
    Code for this emulator lives inside main project's GitHub repository.  

## Supported Applications

This emulator should support every application that uses ARCs (though they have only been found in Jet Set Radio).  

It has been tested with the following:  
- Jet Set Radio HD (PC)

## Example Usage

A. Add a dependency on this mod in your mod configuration. (via `Edit Mod` menu dependencies section, or in `ModConfig.json` directly)

```json
"ModDependencies": ["reloaded.universal.fileemulationframework.arc"]
```

B. Add a folder called `FEmulator/ARC` in your mod folder.  
C. Make folders corresponding to ARC Archive names, e.g. `IMAGES.ARC`.  

Files inside ARC Archives are accessed by the path and filename.  

Inside each folder make files, with names corresponding to the original file's contents.  

### Example(s)

To replace a file in an archive named `IMAGES.ARC`...

Adding `FEmulator/ARC/CUSTOM/IMAGES.ARC/arrow.png` to your mod would replace the item at `arrow.png` in the original ARC Archive.

Adding `FEmulator/ARC/CUSTOM/IMAGES.ARC/PS3/button_a.png` to your mod would replace the item at `/PS3/button_a.png` in the original ARC Archive.

The contents of each ARC file can be found using the JSR ARC Tool, found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/205950/discussions/0/535150948594821347/).

!!! info 

	The files that are being replaced must be the same file format as the new files, you cant replace a .PNG with a .JPG!
