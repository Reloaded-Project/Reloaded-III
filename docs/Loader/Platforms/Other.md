This one covers platforms such as consoles and toothbrushes, where a guaranteed fully working `libc`
is not always present.

## Horizon (Switch)

!!! question "This Topic Needs Research"

    This topic is a grey area for me; I do not own a Modded Switch; just talked a bit with people in the community.
    Any feedback from an expert would be appreciated.

!!! question "Bootloaders?"

    This field is generally confusing in the bootloader aspect; hearing things like 'Skyline is a shot in the dark for non-Smash',
    'Exlaunch is more stable but generally lacking in hooks department', etc.

Need community PR; or a modded Switch. I don't know much about this platform.<br/>
There is demand, but I know very little about the limitations.
