    A collection of preferred practices by Launchers employing this spec. This list is opinionated. It is not enforced, only preferred.

## Don't Store Content in Game Folder

!!! tip

    Try keeping the game folder clean; don't mess it up.

Ideally the user should be able to cleanly install/uninstall the mod loader and their mods.

So keep all your manager/loader related files away from the game folder, or at least in a subfolder like `.Reloaded3`.
